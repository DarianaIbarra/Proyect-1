#Questions:

#WHICH SNPS AND GENES ARE MOST ASSOCIATED WITH PD? WHICH POPULATIONS WERE THESE SAMPLES TAKEN FROM?

#WHAT TYPE OF GENES WERE AFFECTED BY THESE SNPS?

#WHICH PROTEIN-CODING GENES FORM PART OF THE PPI?

#ANALYSIS:

#The SNP rs356182 in the SNCA gene is most associated with Parkinsonâ€™s Disease, with samples taken from diverse populations including European and East Asian origins.

#The SNPs primarily affect genes involved in neuronal function, cellular signaling, and lysosomal activity, critical for maintaining healthy brain cells.

#Protein-coding genes such as SNCA, LRRK2, TMEM175, and BST1 form key parts of the protein-protein interaction network, serving as central hubs.
