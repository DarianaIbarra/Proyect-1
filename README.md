# Bioinformatic_Analysis

#Questions:
#WHICH SNPS AND GENES ARE MOST ASSOCIATED WITH PD? WHICH POPULATIONS WERE THESE SAMPLES TAKEN FROM?
#WHAT TYPE OF GENES WERE AFFECTED BY THESE SNPS?
#WHICH PROTEIN-CODING GENES FORM PART OF THE PPI?

#ANALYSIS:

#Specific SNPs, such as rs356182 in the SNCA gene,  and rs34311866 in TMEM175 gene are strongly linked to Parkinson’s Disease. While the exact distribution isn’t specific in the extracted content, trends in SNP occurrence by population could indicate genetic predispositions.
#The genes mostly affected by the SNPs are "protein coding" and " Intergenic".
#SNCA, LRRK2, TMEM175, BST1 all of these genes play essential roles in maintaining neuronal health and are heavily interconnected within the PPI network, emphasizing their potential contribution to Parkinson’s pathology.
